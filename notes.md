Notes from Cleaning up the cloud to help fight climate change

"Just shut down US East one for Amazon just to see what happens." LOL

HC: I think I mean, yeah, 'cause we make these assumptions about what we need. 
    And then when we start to challenge those assumptions either accidentally through chaos testing,
    or more deliberately we realize we don't like what there's a lot of things that we can do without 
    so I'm hearing these amazing stories now of people that put in just a little bit of automation so 
    that at 5pm, it shuts their servers down. And at 9am, it brings them back up. And as long as you've 
    got the sort of the disposable infrastructure so that you can safely do that, 
    then they can save like a third of their energy usage. 

Resharing of resources. Shutting down servers. Let's take Computer Science seriously.
